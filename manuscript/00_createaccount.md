# Introduction to Github 

Github is a version control platform that allows its users (you) to create, manage, and share projects with others.  It also allows you to view and access the thousands of open-source projects also created on Github.  Its a valuable tool for both beginning and experienced programmers, but before we can use everything Github has to offer, first we must sign up for a Github account.

### Create GitHub Account:

#### Step 1
Type the URL <https://github.com> in your web browser to go to Github's homepage. You should see a page like this:

#### Step 2 
Now that we are on the homepage, look in the top right corner of the website.  You should see the words "Sign up" (circled in purple below).  Click on it to begin the sign up process.

#### Step 3
Now we need to fill in the following three fields. 

* Username:  express yourself, but stay professional. Note that you will choose a username that has not been used before. If you see a green check after you type your username, your are all set!
* Email Address:  enter your email address that you want Github to contact you about information of projects you will be working on.  
* Password:  for security's sake, I suggest using a password that is different than your other passwords. 

When you're done, click on Create an account (the green button) to continue.

#### Step 4
Next we must choose a plan.  We would recommend the free plan for now, the premium plan would be more for private companies.

#### Step 5
This step is optional, but you can let Github know how experienced you are with programming.  Don't worry, your answers will not have an effect on what utilities you can access and use.  You may skip this step if you would like.

#### Step 6
Once you've finished registering, go to the email account you submitted in step 3.  Click the button in the confirmation email to activate your account.

Congratulations! Now you've signed up for Github and can access everything it can offer.
