# GitHub

Now that we have a handle on what version control is and how we can interface with it, we'll take some time to look at GitHub and get familiar with their website. 

As we previously learned, [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a cloud-based management system for your version controlled files. Like DropBox, your files are both locally on your computer *and* hosted online and easily accessible. Its interface allows you to manage version control and provides users with a web-based interface for creating projects, sharing them, updating code, etc. 

### Logging in to GitHub

In the introductory course, you learned how to create a Github account. Use your account username and password to log in to Github. To log in, go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/), where you will be presented with the homepage. If you aren't already logged in, click on the "Sign in" link at the top. 

![GitHub's homepage at https://github.com/](images/01_github/01_githubbasics_github-2.png)

Once you've done that, you will see the log in page where you will enter in your username and password that you created in the first course in this series.

Once logged in, you will be back at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/), but this time the screen should look like this: 

![If you are logged in, GitHub should look like this](images/01_github/01_githubbasics_github-4.png)

### The homepage

We're going to take a quick tour of the GitHub website, and we'll particularly focus on these sections of the interface: 

1. User settings  
2. Notifications  
3. Help files  
4. The GitHub guide

Following this tour, we'll make your very first repository using the GitHub guide!

### User settings

Now that you've logged on to GitHub, we should fill out some of your profile information and get acquainted with the account settings. In the upper right corner, there is a an icon with an arrow beside it, click this and go to "Your profile"

![Where to find user settings](images/01_github/01_githubbasics_github-6.png)

This is where you control your account from and can view your contribution histories and repositories.

Since you are just starting out, you aren't going to have any repositories or contributions yet - but hopefully we'll change that soon enough! What we can do right now is edit your profile. 

Go to "Edit profile" along the lefthand edge of the page. Here, take some time and fill out your name and a little description of yourself in the "Bio" box, and if you like, upload a picture of yourself! When you are done, click "Update profile"

![Your profile page](images/01_github/01_githubbasics_github-8.png)

Along the lefthand side of this page, there are many options for you to explore. Click through each of these menus to get familiar with the options available to you. To get you started, go to the account page. 

![Your account page](images/01_github/01_githubbasics_github-9.png)

Here, you can edit your password or if you are unhappy with your username, change it. Be careful though, there can be [unintended consequences](https://help.github.com/articles/what-happens-when-i-change-my-username/) when you change your username - if you are just starting out and don't have any content yet, you'll probably be safe though. 

Continue looking through the personal setting options on your own. When you are done, go back to your profile. 

Once you've had a bit more experience with GitHub, you'll eventually end up with some repositories to your name. To find those, click on the "Repositories" link on your profile. For now, it will probably look like this: 

![Your repositories page](images/01_github/01_githubbasics_github-11.png)

By the end of the lecture though, check back to this page to find your newly created repository!

### Notifications  

Next, we'll check out the [notifications menu](https://github.com/notifications). Along the menu bar across the top of your window, there is a bell icon, representing your notifications. Click on the bell. 

![Your notifications](images/01_github/01_githubbasics_github-13.png)

Once you become more active on GitHub and are collaborating with others, here is where you can find messages and notifications for all the repositories, teams, and conversations you are a part of. 

### Help files 

Along the bottom of *every. single. page.* there is the ["Help" button](https://help.github.com/). GitHub has a great help system in place - if you ever have a question about GitHub, this should be your first point to search! Take some time now and look through the various help files, and see if any catch your eye.

### The GitHub guide 

GitHub recognizes that this can be an overwhelming process for new users, and as such have developed a mini tutorial to get you started with GitHub. Go through [this guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) now and create your first repository! When you are done, you should have a repository that looks something like this: 

![Your first repository](images/01_github/01_githubbasics_github-17.png)

Take some time to explore around the repository - Check out your commit history so far. Here you can find all of the changes that have been made to the repository, and you can see **who** made the change, **when** they made the change, and provided you wrote an appropriate commit message, you can see **why** they made the change! It should look like similar to this: 

![Your first repository's commit history](images/01_github/01_githubbasics_github-18.png)

Once you've explored all of the options in the repository, go back to your user profile. It should look a little different from before: 

![Your profile now shows your first repository](images/01_github/01_githubbasics_github-19.png)

Now when you are on your profile you can see your latest repository created and for a complete listing of your repositories, click on the "Repositories" tab. Here you can see all of your repositories, a brief description, the time of the last edit, and along the right hand side, there is an activity graph, showing when and how many edits have been made on the repository.

### Summary

In this lesson we looked at GitHub and its interface. We took a tour of the website and its interface. We customized your profile to give people some more information on who you are. We made our very first repository by following the GitHub guide and explored the various options GitHub provides for exploring repositories.
