Now that we have a handle on what version control is and how we can interface with it, we'll take some time to look at Git Hub and get familiar with their website. 

As we previously learned, Git Hub is a cloud-based management system for your version controlled files. Like Drop Box, your files are both locally on your computer and hosted online and easily accessible. Its interface allows you to manage version control and provides users with a web-based interface for creating projects, sharing them, updating code, etc. 

To log on to Git Hub, go to Git Hub.com, where you will be presented with the homepage. If you aren't already logged in, click on the "Sign in" link at the top. 

Once you've done that, you will see the log in page where you will enter in your username and password that you created in the first course in this series. 

Once logged in, you will be back at Git Hub.com, but this time the screen should look like this: 

We're going to take a quick tour of the Git Hub website, and we'll particularly focus on the user settings, notifications, help files, and the Git Hub guide. Following this tour, we'll make your very first repository using the Git Hub guide! 

Now that you've logged on to Git Hub, we should fill out some of your profile information and get acquainted with the account settings. In the upper right corner, there is a an icon with an arrow beside it, click this and go to "Your profile"

This is where you control your account from and can view your contribution histories and repositories. Since you are just starting out, you aren't going to have any repositories or contributions yet - but hopefully we'll change that soon enough! What we can do right now is edit your profile. Go to "Edit profile" along the lefthand edge of the page. 

Here, take some time and fill out your name and a little description of yourself in the "Bio" box, and if you like, upload a picture of yourself! When you are done, click "Update profile" Along the lefthand side of this page, there are many options for you to explore. Click through each of these menus to get familiar with the options available to you. To get you started, go to the account page. 

Here, you can edit your password or if you are unhappy with your username, change it. Be careful though, there can be unintended consequences when you change your username - if you are just starting out and don't have any content yet, you'll probably be safe though. 

The Account tab lets you change your username or password. The Emails tab lets you modify what e-mail address(es) to use for notifications and has some privacy settings relating to where your e-mail addresses can appear publicly. The Notifications tab allows you to fine tune what GitHub updates send notifications and where they are sent. Continue looking through the personal setting options on your own. When you are done, go back to your profile. 

Once you've had a bit more experience with Git Hub, you'll eventually end up with some repositories to your name. To find those, click on the "Repositories" link on your profile. 

For now, it will probably look empty like this.

Next, we'll check out the notifications menu. Along the menu bar across the top of your window, there is a bell icon, representing your notifications. Click on the bell. 

Once you become more active on Git Hub and are collaborating with others, here is where you can find messages and notifications for all the repositories, teams, and conversations you are a part of. 

Along the bottom of every single page there is the "Help" button. Git Hub has a great help system in place - if you ever have a question about Git Hub, this should be your first point to search! 

Take some time now and look through the various help files, and see if any catch your eye.
