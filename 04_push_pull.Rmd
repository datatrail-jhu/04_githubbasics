# Pushing and Pulling Changes

Now that you have learned how to create a repository and clone it, it's time to start using repositories to manage projects and work with collaborators. In this lesson you will learn about new git commands for publishing changes so that others can see them. You will also learn a git command for incorporating changes made by others in your local copy of a repository.

#### Get Status

A helpful git command is `git status`. If you type this in the terminal and press "enter" on your keyboard, the files that have been modified or added since you last updated changes on GitHub will be displayed. 

However, before working with the git commands that will track and publish our changes, we need to change the working directory in the Terminal to be the `first_project` folder. We can do this with the `cd` command. Using the command `cd PATH` changes the working directory to the folder specified by `PATH`. For example, if the `first_project` folder contained a folder called `analysis`, we could set our Terminal working directory to this folder with `cd first_project/analysis`. To continue change the working directory by typing the command `cd first_project` in the prompt.

As you've just cloned a repository in the last lesson, there are no changes yet. You can type `git status` at any time in the Terminal to see what files have been modified locally that are not yet on GitHub. This is particularly helpful when you want to decide which files to stage, which is discussed in more detail later in this lesson.

### Pushing

Over the course of working on a project, you will be creating a number of files containing code, results, documentation, or other information. How do you add these files to the Git version control system and make this information available to the public? In the first part of this lesson, you will learn about three git commands that allow you to do this: add, commit, and push.

#### Create a File

Let's start by creating a file within the project. Below we've created a text file containing a list of tasks. This is saved as tasks.txt within the `first_project` folder. This is the repository that we cloned in the previous lesson.


![Creating a file in our project repository](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1syZGx4saIzmiWVGZzIjqBjQaGkFXyC_Hlo5Pq-edYs8/export/png?id=1syZGx4saIzmiWVGZzIjqBjQaGkFXyC_Hlo5Pq-edYs8&pageid=g388478d6c4_0_0)


#### Staging and Committing

Now that we have added a file to this repository, let's put it under version control and publish these changes. First we need to move to the Terminal pane. Recall that the text at the beginning of the line is called the **prompt**. The Terminal prompt shows the current working directory within the Terminal. Initially, the working directory is the `/cloud/project` folder. We can see the same information by entering the `pwd` command. We can use the `ls` command to list the files and folders that are in the current working directory. If you haven't previously added any files or folders here, you'll see that the `first_project` folder is the only thing present.

We will first use the `git add` command to tell Git that the `tasks.txt` file is to be tracked for version control. The syntax for the `add` command is:

```text
git add file_or_folder1 file_or_folder2
```

This "stages" the the specified files or folders, adding them to the list of directories and files that should be added to GitHub.  

Any number of files and/or folders can be specified in this way. To add the `tasks.txt` file, we use

```text
git add tasks.txt
```

While you only have a file or two to add at this point and typing them each individually is not much work, as you start work on larger projects and edit multiple files at a time, typing out each file you want to add individually will become a pain. To get around this, you can specify that you want to stage multiple files at once using the following syntax:

```text
git add .
```

Here, a period has been added after `git add`. What this does is stage (add) **new and modified files**. However, this does not stage files that have been deleted.

Alternatively, to add **modified and deleted files** but to *not* include new files, you would use the following syntax:

```text
git add -u
```

To add **all files**, adding new, modified, and deleted files, you would use the following syntax:

```text
git add -A
```

The final shortcut we'll discuss for staging files is the ability to use the wildcard (*) character with `git add`. Here, wildcard character (*) followed by .csv specifies that you want to stage any file that has the file extension ".csv".

```text
git add *.csv
```

You could alternatively use `git add *`. However, if you remember back to the lesson on removing files, you were cautioned against ever using `rm *` because you can very easily but accidentally delete files you didn't mean to delete. The same logic works here. `git add *` will add everything, including hidden files, and thus should be **used with caution**. Instead, use options discussed above to stage your files.


![git add summary table](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1syZGx4saIzmiWVGZzIjqBjQaGkFXyC_Hlo5Pq-edYs8/export/png?id=1syZGx4saIzmiWVGZzIjqBjQaGkFXyC_Hlo5Pq-edYs8&pageid=g3b5b846a8f_2_0)

Now that we have let git know that which file should be tracked for version control, we will actually record those changes with `git commit`. The `commit` command takes the files that we added with `add` and updates the Git version history record with these changes. When we use the `commit` command we also supply a descriptive message about the changes that were made by specifying the `-m` option followed by the message in quotes. You can write anything as the message, however, since you may go back to your previous commits some day, it's considered good practice to write a descriptive message that has some information about the nature of the changed you made.

```text
git commit -m "Add task list"
```

#### Verifying Your Identity

On RStudio Cloud, you'll have to verify who you are each time you try to make changes to a repository.

You'll know you have to do this when you try to `git commit` and you get an error that starts with: "Please tell me who you are," followed with some suggestions about using `git config`.

When this occurs, you'll be prompted to type the following into the terminal:

```text
git config user.name "UserName"
git config user.email "email@domain.com"
```

To do this, you'll first specify your username. To do this, if your GitHub username were JaneEveryayDoe you would type the following and then press enter:

```text
git config user.name "JaneEverydayDoe"
```

If your email address connected to your GitHub account were "janeeverydaydoe@gmail.com", you would then type the following and press enter:

```text
git config user.email "email@domain.com"
```

Note: If you're asked for your password, you should type in your GitHub password and hit Enter, but know that you will not actually see the characters show up on the screen as you type them.

#### Publishing changes (pushing)

We are finally ready to publish our changes to a **remote repository**. We've been doing work in a local copy of the repository on RStudio Cloud. This personal copy is called a **local repository**. To make changes available to others, there needs to be an external version of the repository accessible by others. This is called a **remote repository**. Our remote repository is the one available on GitHub. To publish our changes, we use the `git push` command. Because we cloned this repository from GitHub, Git automatically knows that this is the remote repository. A local repository can have multiple remotes, and it is possible to push changes to a specified remote. We will not cover this here though. After you run `git push`, you will see some status text and you will be prompted for your GitHub username and password. After you enter these, the push will be complete.


![Pushing changes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1syZGx4saIzmiWVGZzIjqBjQaGkFXyC_Hlo5Pq-edYs8/export/png?id=1syZGx4saIzmiWVGZzIjqBjQaGkFXyC_Hlo5Pq-edYs8&pageid=g388478d6c4_0_13)

### Pulling

While working on a project, we may have a collaborator working on files in the same repository. If they create and edit files in their own local repositories and push changes to our shared remote repository on GitHub, we will want to incorporate their changes into our files. We can do this with `git pull`.

For example, a collaborator might have added an additional task to the `tasks.txt` file.


![Seeing on GitHub that a file has been edited](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1syZGx4saIzmiWVGZzIjqBjQaGkFXyC_Hlo5Pq-edYs8/export/png?id=1syZGx4saIzmiWVGZzIjqBjQaGkFXyC_Hlo5Pq-edYs8&pageid=g388478d6c4_0_20)

When we run the `git pull` command, the changes present in the remote repository are incorporated into our local repository. So when we open the `tasks.txt` file, we will see the additional task.

### Practice

To get more practice with these concepts, as we know they are not the easiest, we suggest you go practice at [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/). Here you can practices your git commands and get feedback as to what you've done correctly and where you steered off course. It's a great way to get better at using git commands before you move onto the quiz!
